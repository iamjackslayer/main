== PROJECT: ClinicIO

---

== 1. Overview
This portfolio serves the purpose of documenting my contributions to the project - ClinicIO. ClinicIO is a command-oriented desktop software for clinic use with the aim of making the lives of receptionists, doctors and patients easier. Command line is the primary mode of input due to the assessment constraints. Nonetheless, the visual output is graphical.

Our team consists of three primary developers, an assistant team lead and a team lead. As an assistant team lead, I assist the team lead in the overall project coordination. Furthermore, I am responsible for the logic component of the software.

In this project, I have designed and developed some crucial features of the software which are listed below: +

* Assign a patient into the queue
* Remove a particular patient from the queue
* Show all the patients in the queue

I worked mainly on designing the queue and the algorithm of the queueing system. This system aims to achieve fairness, efficiency and flexibility.

Besides queue, I have designed the model for a patient so that the data associated with patients can be stored efficiently in our database.

Lastly, I am the main tester of ClinicIO. I ensure all the components are integrated properly and thoroughly tested before the software is deployed.


== 2. Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section outlines the major and minor enhancements I made to ClinicIO. In addition, other relevant contributions made to the project and my team as a whole are also included._
|===
==== Major enhancement 1 - added the ability to assign a patient into the queue:
** *What it does:* It allows the user to assign a patient into the queue based on the index of the patient in the patient display list.
** *Justification:* This feature improves the product significantly because a user - typically a receptionist - needs to routinely place patients into the queue.
** *Highlight:* This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required a new data structure to save the queue into the hard disk. Besides, it must always reflect the latest status of the queue.
** *Code snippet for enqueuing a patient:* +
`model.enqueue((Patient) patientToEnqueue);`

==== Major enhancement 2 - added the ability to remove a patient from the queue:
** *What it does:* It allows the user - typically a receptionist - to remove a patient from the queue based on the index of the patient in the patient display list.
** *Justification:* This feature improves the product significantly because the user can carry out his/her daily routine, in particular removing a patient from the queue, more efficiently without affecting existing patients in the queue.
** *Code snippet for dequeuing a patient:* +
`model.dequeue((Patient) patientToDequeue);`

==== Major enhancement 3 - designed the preference-based queuing algorithm:
** *What it does:* It determines which patient in the queue to go for consultation based on his/her preference for any doctor.
** *Justification:* This feature serves the need of many patients who opt for a specific doctor for consultation. It ensures fairness by prioritising patients who arrive earlier.
** *Activity diagram for selecting a patient for consultation:* +

==== Major enhancement 4 - added the ability to show all patients currently in the queue:
** *What it does:* It allows the user - typically a receptionist - to display all patients currently in the queue.
** *Justification:* This feature is useful because patients sometimes would enquire the time it takes for their turn to come. The receptionist can use this simple feature to display all patients in the queue and relay necessary information (how many patients are in front of the asking patient) to the patients.
** *Code snippet for showing the queue:* +
`model.updateFilteredPersonList(model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PATIENTS_IN_QUEUE);`


==== Major enhancement 5 - designed the Patient model:
** *What it does:* It represents the patient in digital format.
** *Justification:* This feature is crucial because it allows the receptionist to store all relevant information associated with a patient into our database. This allows the receptionist to easily query a patient given some information about the patient.
** *Class diagram for a patient:* +
